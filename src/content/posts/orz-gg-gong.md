# ORZ

*(Verse 1)*\
Yo, GG_Gong, you think you're the king,
But when you step up, all I hear is a ding,
Your rhymes are weak, man, they barely sting,
Step aside, son, I'll show you how to swing.

*(Chorus)*\
GG_Gong, you’re a joke, nothing but a fraud,
Steppin’ to me? Man, that’s just flawed,
You’re out of your league, in way too deep,
I’ll bury you now, put your rep to sleep.

*(Verse 2)*\
You think you’re clever, but you’re just a bore,
Every line you spit, man, I’ve heard it before,
I’ll take you down easy, leave you on the floor,
You're playing checkers, I'm mastering war.

*(Chorus)*\
GG_Gong, you’re a joke, nothing but a fraud,
Steppin’ to me? Man, that’s just flawed,
You’re out of your league, in way too deep,
I’ll bury you now, put your rep to sleep.

*(Bridge)*\
You’re just a meme, while I’m a legacy,
Your lines are weak, and your style’s elementary,
Step back now, accept your defeat,
GG_Gong, you're obsolete.

*(Outro)*\
So GG_Gong, take this L and go,
I’m the real deal, now you know,
Bow down, son, and learn from the best,
I’m the king of this game, better than the rest.
